# Build Together

Build Together is a Discord community for builders that includes custom
commands for keeping track of TODOs, daily streaks, goals, and more.

Social media such as Twitter or Indie Hackers can be good, but has a few
problems:

- It's incentivized to hoard your time and attention;
- Revolves around the news of the day - no long term focus;
- Makes it hard to form relationships and feel part of a community.

These are the problems that Build Together sets out to solve.

We encourage each other to focus on what is meaningful, with tools that help
us hold each other accountable and prioritize the important things each person
has to say.

To join, simply go to `discord.gg/AN74_XJ`, replacing the underscore with the
first letter in the word "Zebra" (uppercase).
