# Build Together

Build Together is a Discord community for builders that includes custom
commands for keeping track of TODOs, daily streaks, goals, and more.

Social media such as Twitter or Indie Hackers can be good, but has a few
problems:

- It's incentivized to hoard your time and attention;
- Revolves around the news of the day - no long term focus;
- Makes it hard to form relationships and feel part of a community.

These are the problems that Build Together sets out to solve.

We encourage each other to focus on what is meaningful, with tools that help
us hold each other accountable and prioritize the important things each person
has to say.

To join, simply go to `discord.gg/AN74_XJ`, replacing the underscore with the
first letter in the word "Zebra" (uppercase).

## FAQ

> Who is behind this community?

Me, [Marcos](https://twitter.com/voxelbased). I do freelance programming for a
living and also build my own projects.

> Where can I see which custom commands are available in the server?

If you are reading this now you are actually quite early - I am still developing
the application that powers this community. It is called Giza, because we are a
bit like pyramid builders (I'll leave the details of that comparison for you to
decide).

> Who should join this community?

Anyone interested in building cool things that feels they could benefit from a
little companionship and accountability.

> How much does it cost?

Nothing, but I'm thinking about creating a relatively cheap subscription plan
in the future. I'd have to find out how to bring more value without making
anyone feel left out.

> If it's free, what do you gain from it?

I often feel lonely and demotivated when working on my own, and social media
has fallen short of solving this. I mainly end up spending a lot of time
catching up on different people who are yelling into the void.

I think this can be much better with the right functionality, designed with the
right incentives - which I do have!
